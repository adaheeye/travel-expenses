# Travel Expenses - Angular Project

## Description

Travel Expenses is a full-stack web application designed to manage group expenses for travelers. The application is built with Angular and features a responsive user interface that allows users to create travelers and activities, and track expenses. Users can enter who paid for an activity and who owes money, and the application calculates and displays who owes what. The app also features a filter to display all expenses and travelers.

The Angular front-end communicates with the [Travel Expenses REST API](https://github.com/Abdirahim888/travel-expenses-server) built with Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB for data storage.
